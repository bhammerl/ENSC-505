# ENSC-505
Creating Landsat and MODIS image collections for use with the LandTrendr algorithm in GEE
Using LandTrendr with both image collections to detect the "year of disturbance" values of specified points in order to determine when landcover changes occured
Outputs include a spectral trajectory chart and a year of disturbance value 
The detected year of disturbance values were compared to actual year of disturbance values to compare the ability of Landsat and MODIS imagery to detect disturbances of varying sizes (and therefore the importance of spectral and temporal resolution)
The points used to run this code were randomly selected within roads, well pads, and harvest areas with known year of disturbance values
